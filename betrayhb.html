    				    <h2>About</h2>
        				<p> The fulcrum of advancement in buxy vill, a close neighbior to the feculence of zaibathopia, was all due to the historic figure known as buxymaloan. Most famous for her betrayal of the souuw couincil. The city ,unlike zaibathopia, has atleast a tiny amount of dignity as it is made from wooden buildings and tents. The main attraction of buxyvill is the fact that its townsfolk consist of jesters and funny bastards that are twistered and dementered as they are all from the deepest darkest parts of the founder Haázra Büx.</p>

    		        <h2>Life</h2>
    		  		<p>She started out as a simple tavern girl working in the better parts of the capital city. She was content with her life however after years of being passed aound by knights like the black knight chickoleolus. She realised the truth, that she was a slave to the system, and so was everyone else. the nobles all sat in their tall towers comanding the commonfolk to build this or farm that and keep them in line by sending pitifyl amaounts of coin their way. they were just sheep used to build the empires that a nobody ruled. without people to rule over a king had no kingdom.<br>
				Every day her rution was the same: wake up clean the tarvon, serve breakfast till noon, have a brake, meet a knight, then back to work till sunset. schools forced children to regegatate pointless knowledge and made u ssmart enough to do work we needed but not smart enough to question why. they then work and work with no time to live the life they worked for and then comes a time when they become elderly an fraile and are left to die while the next genarations repeate the cycle. all the while the shady men at the top profit from their suffering. we belive we all live uniuqe lives but the truth is we are just fule for the shady men upstairs. this is their world and the commonwealth is there most valuable resource. the poor folk build their citys, farm their food and fight their wars. they are aready cristened in money so thats not what drives them, POWER is. Ans money is simply a tool used to extort and control the commonfolk. worthless cicular metal we use to feed ourselves.<br>
					election is the the same as a coin, toss it and it will either be heads or tails but what you fail to see is that they are both part of the same coin. they choses whose face rules them but its just an ilousion of change and choice. but the world remains the same. we are so caught up on following the leader but we forget to lead ourselves. <br>
					after seeing how the people with nothing seam to be the happiest. we look to find some one to change us without even thinking of changing ourself. faith in the Staff is tested, men hiding in the desert, men excited then enlithened by the scientific method.<br>
					With the revelation that even if she wont be here the world will and so she set of to escape the system of being livestock for those shady men. "my story hasn't been written yet" -Buxy malon Est.023 26 age. or so she thought.
