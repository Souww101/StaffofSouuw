    				    <h2>About</h2>
        				<p> The fulcrum of advancement in buxy vill, a close neighbior to the feculence of zaibathopia, was all due to the historic figure known as buxymaloan. Most famous for her betrayal of the souuw couincil. The city ,unlike zaibathopia, has atleast a tiny amount of dignity as it is made from wooden buildings and tents. The main attraction of buxyvill is the fact that its townsfolk consist of jesters and funny bastards that are twistered and dementered as they are all from the deepest darkest parts of the founder Haázra Büx.</p>
