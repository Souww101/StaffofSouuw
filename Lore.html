  <h1>Wad Up Peps</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Followers of Souuw, I, Don of Souuw, inscribe upon this electronic stone tablet the history of the two staves; Souuw and Wiseness. It is a fable that shook the entire univers and caused the big bang. Yes <b>That</b> big bang</p>
  <p>The Decrepit tablet was found buried in rural soil by a unnamed sheaperd 15 centurys ago. He was called Unname protagonist 1. This discuvary altered his fate as he was branded a Heratic and hunted relentlessly by wiseness haters known as the Cqudh (silent q)</p>
  <p>The sheaperd decipered the text after many visions from a blaged poltragist.</p>
