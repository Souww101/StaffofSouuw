        <p>Followers of Souuw, I, Don of Souuw, inscribe upon this electronic stone tablet the history of the two staves; Souuw and Wiseness. It is a fable that shook the entire universe and caused the big bang. Yes <b>That</b> big bang</p>
        <p>The Decrepit tablet was found buried in rural soil by a unnamed shepherd 15 centuries ago. He was called Unnamed protagonist 1 or Von for short. This discovery altered his fate as he was branded a Heretic and hunted relentlessly by wiseness haters known as the Cqudh (silent q)</p>
        <p>The sheaperd decipered the text after many visions from a blaged poltergeist. This is where our story begins... Well actually it’s a few days before that </p><br>

        <p>Important things to note: Sheap- the alter-earth versions of sheep. <br>sheapered- the alter-earth version of shepherd. <br>ironwood- wood from a metal saturated tree that agonises beast because of the nature element embeded within it.<br>
          Zaibathopia-Zaibathiopia streets and houses were made out of mud and hardend shit, only shops and important buildings were made out of wood. Any high-class citizen would vomit at the sight of such a ugly town. <br> The town was named after a woman who was a fallen noble tryed to take over her fathers land but failed misrably. She was crucified for being a witch and was later reancaneted as a lich queen only to be slayn by the man she had a crush one.
          To add even more shit to this tale the slayer shat on her mouth and buried her with horse shit. To Keep her from reencarnating again her father built Zaibathiopia for a class lower than lowborn known as shitheads. An that is how Zaibathopia was created</p>
        <p>Ranger- A man tasked with protecting his lands from sanity spawns with his enhanced abilities. Rangers are trained with wiseness granted for a short time that allows the training for 1000 days to be completed within a single day. They train for 3 years at which point they can accumulate their own wiseness even if it doesn’t last long.</p>

        <h3><i>Note inportant plot points missed : family, ranger abilitys , trainign, temple, concil of shitheads, demi-gods, scapegoat, arciologist.</i></h3>

        <p> In the small poor town of zaibathiopia where only filthy, low-life, barely even people lived, there the sheaperd known as Von who guided his little lost sheap to grazing fields along the sourthen coast. As he sat there on-looking the nonchalant sheap he pondered upon the big questions in life like "What will I do in the future?, Will I always be a lowly peasent?, why is baa baa a black sheap anyway?". Every day he asks similar questions and leaves felling gloomy, but who could blame him, all he did all day was stare at sheep eating, sleeping, mating (not always with other sheap) and ocasinaly using his ironwood staff to fend off onslauts of wolves.</p>

        <p> He lived with a group of sheapereds under the town monastery’s/temple’s roof. Unlike the other sheapered that raised him Von did not practise patience or humbleness, this often left him being outcast and frowned upon by the town as sheapereds were generally looked on for help when travellers or citizens needed it. This is because sheapereds are members of the monastery and are said to be blessed. “But what does the opinions of shit eaters matter to me anyway” Von thought. His rebellious actions had caused more than a few incidences around town. That day was just like every other and the sheapered lead his herd back in to town as the sun set.</p>

        <p> After leaving his herd in the stables he paced around town looking for a good pub to fill his empty stomach in. "This is bare effort" he exclaims with a heavy sigh. He takes a few steps and then<br>WHOOP!!<br> He falls flat on his face. "Da Fuq's wrong with shit its all bullshit anyway" he angrly screams and proceedes to get up.<i>"Huh I feel really heavy"</i>. "What a vulgar mouth you have old man, though what could one excect from a baseborn pleabien." said a elegent voice from above. " Old man im only 25" Von began to doubt wether he triped or someone had landed on him as the weight above him slowly vanished. It seemed that a girl had landed on top of Von which is totaly not a cliche opening at all. The girl looked around 13 or 14 and anexpression of utter disgust at being in a low-tier town</p>

        <p>“ Da fuq’s your problem you fat kid”, She looked at him shocked.</p>
        <p>“I thought a sheapered would have <b>more</b> respect!”</p>
        <p>“I dident ask for your bloody opinion”</p>
        <p>“*annoyed gasp of air* I’LL HAVE YOU KNO…” “GET BUK ERE YA FILTHY RASCAL!” Shouted someone from a third story building, interrupting the girl. “TCH, disgusting peasants” she said under her breath and ran of like the road runner from looney tunes. “Surprisingly fast for a fatty” thought Von </p>
        <p> Later that night he met with his mentor, the former ranger of the southern cites named Talion, and began his training. He was granted exposure to a tiny amount of wiseness which let hit train a weeks’ worth in an hour. It was due to this that Von could fend of wolves single handily “<i>and not work with those other pussy sheapereds</i>” was his opinion.  Talion smiled, “Kid the council wants your report in next week so you better have something ready”. <br>

        “Nothing ever happens in this place anyway I’ll just blag some shizniz to dem shitheads”.<br>

        “Kid Its important so don’t muck about, if you ever want to become more than a sheap fucking peasant you need to earn their favour” <br>

        “Aright fine I’ll try”. Though he knew he wouldn’t and Talion could see Von’s sardonic smile.<br>

        “Stay out of trouble kid there’s some nobles in town and with your reputation we may loss even more funding than last year thanks to that elaborate prank of yours.”<br>

        “ Hey, how was I supposed to know his hair would light on fire, ha ha ha, he’s bold now , ha ha ha”<br>

        “Ahah ha ha”. Talion chuckled cheerfully at the remembrance of the event. He wiped the tear of laughter from his eye while stopping the training</p>
         <br>
        <p> The next morning  on the way to gather his sheap, Von noticed lots of people with well equiped backbacks roaming around the stables. "Must be the nobles Talion mentioned, noise bunch" ran through Vons' mind.
