  <p>Followers of Souuw, I, Don of Souuw, inscribe upon this electronic stone tablet the history of the two staves; Souuw and Wiseness. It is a fable that shook the entire universe and caused the big bang. Yes <b>That</b> big bang</p>
  <p>The Decrepit tablet was found buried in rural soil by a unnamed shepherd 15 centuries ago. He was called Unnamed protagonist 1 or Von for short. This discovery altered his fate as he was branded a Heretic and hunted relentlessly by wiseness haters known as the Cqudh (silent q)</p>
  <p>The sheaperd decipered the text after many visions from a blaged poltergeist. This is where our story begins...</p><br>
    <p>Important things to note: Sheap- the alter-earth versions of sheep. sheapered- the alter-earth version of shepherd. ironwood- wood from a metal saturated tree that agonises beast because of the nature element embeded within it. Zaibathopia-Zaibathiopia streets and houses were made out of mud and hardend shit, only shops and important buildings were made out of wood. Any high-class citizen would vomit at the sight of such a ugly town. <br> The town was named after a woman who was a fallen noble tryed to take over her fathers land but failed misrably. She was crucified for being a witch and was later reancaneted as a lich queen only to be slayn by the man she had a crush one. To add even more shit to this tale the slayer shat on her mouth and buried her with horse shit. To Keep her from reencarnating again her father built Zaibathiopia for a class lower than lowborn known as shitheads. An that is how Zaibathopia was created</p>
    <h3><i>Note inportant plot points missed : family, ranger abilitys , trainign, temple, concil of shitheads, demi-gods, scapegoat, arciologist.</i></h3>
    <p> In the small poor town of zaibathiopia where only filthy, low-life, barely even people lived, there the sheaperd known as Von who guided his little lost sheap to grazing fields along the sourthen coast. As he sat there on-looking the nonchalant sheap he pondered upon the big questions in life like "What will I do in the future?, Will I always be a lowly peasent?, why is baa baa a black sheap anyway?". Every day he asks similar questions and leaves felling gloomy, but who could blame him, all he did all day was stare at sheep eating, sleeping, mating (not always with other sheap) and ocasinaly using his ironwood staff to fend off onslauts of wolves. That day was just like every other and the sheapered lead his herd back in to town as the sun set.</p>
    <p> After leaving his herd in the stables he paced around town looking for a good pub to fill his empty stomach in. "This is bare effort" he exclaims with a heavy sigh. He takes a few steps and then<br>WHOOP!!<br> He falls flat on his face. "Da Fuq's wrong with shit its all bullshit anyway" he angrly screams and proceedes to get up.<i>"Huh I feel really heavy"</i>. "What a vulgar mouth you have old man, though what could one excect from a baseborn pleabien." said a elegent voice from above. " Old man im only 25" Von began to doubt wether he triped or someone had landed on him as the weight above him slowly vanished. It seamed that a girl had landed on top of Von which is totaly not a cliche opening at all. The girl looked around 13 or 14 and an expersion of utter discust at being in a low-tier town</p>
