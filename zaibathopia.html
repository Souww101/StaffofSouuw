  <h2> The day the disu died aka the day sir saboor landed on earth </h2>
    
    <p> During the annual Disu pilgram to the shitvill zaibathopia one particular young disu was also present. This Disu had longed to leave the disu clan and do her own shizniz like the rebelious little shyte eater she was. <br>
      The Disu tribe made camp 5 miles from zaibatopia, they planned to hurry with the pilgram and leave the turd of a town behind. "No one in their right mind would spend the night there", was what Great grandma Disu used to say. <br>
      The young disu, nymira, glanced up at the vast darkness of the sky, she dreamed of of breaking the rules in the most succulant manner she could think of, but alas she could do nothing but let off a deep sigh as she crawled in to bed.<br>
      Her eyes began to feel heavy and just before they closed for good, a huge BOOM!!! filled the sky with the brightest light in the darkest night (of the year).
