  <h2><u> The day the disu died aka the day sir jeeeef hussein landed on earth </u></h2>
    
    <p> During the annual Disu pilgram to the shitvill zaibathopia, one particular young disu was also present. This Disu had longed to leave the disu clan and do her own shizniz like the rebelious little shyte eater she was. <br>
      The Disu tribe made camp 5 miles from zaibatopia, they planned to hurry with the pilgram and leave the turd of a town behind. "No one in their right mind would spend the night there", was what Great grandma Disu used to say. <br>
      The young disu, nymira, glanced up at the vast darkness of the sky, she dreamed of of breaking the rules in the most succulant manner she could think of, but alas she could do nothing but let off a deep sigh as she crawled in to bed.<br>
      Her eyes began to feel heavy and just before they closed for good, a huge BOOM!!! filled the sky with the brightest light in the darkest night (of the year).
      Panicing she looked around franticly for the other members of Disu, but to no avil. <i>"Oh no, where is everyone"</i> she thought still looking side to side like a skooby doo charector.<br>
      In the distance a mushroom cloud of green smoke could be seen. She imagened to others would have gone to investigate so she sprinted of towards the smoke. As she got closer she could begin to feel the heat from the inpact on her skin however it was not a burning feeling, more like when the warmth of a puppy.<br>
      Eventually she reached the crash site to a bright green light in the center of black lumps on the ground. As her eyes adjusted they then began widthning as the horrer of what actually happened began to sink in. The hairs on the back of her neck (under her scarf) began to stand on end as she witnessed the black lumps all had the signiture disu scarfs nearby.<br>
      Before she even fully processed the scene a man appered from amidst the brightness. His body tall but skinny, his nose built (has 6 pack) but pointy and his hair flat but 90 degrees upwards.<br>
      He steped out of the light and in to the dark, this statment alone explains the splitting of the staff- a story for another time.<br>
      He glared an Nymira fearcely but confused. "Why don't you burn?", he asked in the most ridiculus nerdy voice. Nymira had to fight to keep in the laughter. "Oi, I asked a question" his voice even squeaker. She puffed her cheeks desprete to not burst out, tears dribbling out her eyes. <br>
      He took a step forward, and then fell face first to the ground!! Nymira now strugling for air tring to keep her mouth shoot, breathing solely through her nose with tears absolutly pouring out her eyes like some FUCKING CARTOON 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
   </p>

  <p>
    He stood up and brushed the dirt of himself then slowly lifted his head. Suddenly he locked eyes with Nymira and ridiculusly squecked <i><b>"My names Jeeeef"</i></b> before vomiting everywhere and collapsing.<br>
    That was it she had had enough and exploded with laugther "AHAHAHAHAHAHAH AHAH AHAHAAHA AHAHAHAHAHAHA AHAHAHA". She continued for ages, cackling like a witch ,only taking short breath inbetween long periods of insane laughter unhinged by her dead tribe mates. If anyone else saw this they would immeditly thinks she was demented and leg it in the opposit direction.<br>
    <i><u>Stay vigilant for part 2 next time if I can be asked, i mean its like 2 in the morning cba with life and shit</u></i>
