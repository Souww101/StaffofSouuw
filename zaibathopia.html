  <h2><u> The day the disu died aka the day sir jeeeef hussein landed on earth </u></h2>
    
    <p> During the annual Disu pilgram to the shitvill zaibathopia, one particular young disu was also present. This Disu had longed to leave the disu clan and do her own shizniz like the rebelious little shyte eater she was. <br>
      The Disu tribe made camp 5 miles from zaibatopia, they planned to hurry with the pilgram and leave the turd of a town behind. "No one in their right mind would spend the night there", was what Great grandma Disu used to say. <br>
      The young disu, nymira, glanced up at the vast darkness of the sky, she dreamed of of breaking the rules in the most succulant manner she could think of, but alas she could do nothing but let off a deep sigh as she crawled in to bed.<br>
      Her eyes began to feel heavy and just before they closed for good, a huge BOOM!!! filled the sky with the brightest light in the darkest night (of the year).
      Panicing she looked around franticly for the other members of Disu, but to no avil. <i>"Oh no, where is everyone"</i> she thought still looking side to side like a skooby doo charector.<br>
      In the distance a mushroom cloud of green smoke could be seen. She imagened to others would have gone to investigate so she sprinted of towards the smoke. As she got closer she could begin to feel the heat from the inpact on her skin however it was not a burning feeling, more like when the warmth of a puppy.<br>
      Eventually she reached the crash site to a bright green light in the center of black lumps on the ground. As her eyes adjusted they then began widthning as the horrer of what actually happened began to sink in. The hairs on the back of her neck (under her scarf) began to stand on end as she witnessed the black lumps all had the signiture disu scarfs nearby.<br>
      Before she even fully processed the scene a man appered from amidst the brightness. His body tall but skinny, his nose built (has 6 pack) but pointy and his hair flat but 90 degrees upwards.<br>
      He steped out of the light and in to the dark, this statment alone explains the splitting of the staff- a story for another time.<br>
      He glared an Nymira fearcely but confused. "Why don't you burn?", he asked in the most ridiculus nerdy voice. Nymira had to fight to keep in the laughter. "Oi, I asked a question" his voice even squeaker. She puffed her cheeks desprete to not burst out, tears dribbling out her eyes. <br>
      He took a step forward, and then fell face first to the ground!! Nymira now strugling for air tring to keep her mouth shoot, breathing solely through her nose with tears absolutly pouring out her eyes like some FUCKING CARTOON ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£.
   </p>

   <p>
     He stood up and brushed the dirt of himself then slowly lifted his head. Suddenly he locked eyes with Nymira and ridiculusly squecked <i><b>"My names Jeeeef"</i></b> before vomiting everywhere and collapsing.<br>
     That was it she had had enough and exploded with laugther "AHAHAHAHAHAHAH AHAH AHAHAAHA AHAHAHAHAHAHA AHAHAHA". She continued for ages, cackling like a witch ,only taking short breath inbetween long periods of insane laughter unhinged by her dead tribe mates. If anyone else saw this they would immeditly thinks she was demented and leg it in the opposit direction.<br>
     <i><u>Stay vigilant for part 2 next time if I can be asked, i mean its like 2 in the morning cba with life and shit</u></i>

   <h2><u>He could have raped the belender but he couldn‚Äôt if he would have then he could have but he might have if he hadn‚Äôt slipped unless he would have landed directly in ‚Äúit‚Äù but didn‚Äôt because he couldn‚Äôt.</u></h2>
   <p>
Beneath the grand ruby dome behind the humping angel statues the small council of lords and lady‚Äôs gathered to eradicate zaibathopia from the history books.  The capital of prostitiooon and human(parts). It had been a thorn in the council‚Äôs side for decades, forever penetrating their ruptured buttucks. They had had enough. It was time to send in the <b>blender</b> aka the spiritual leader of souuw. His mission to retrieve intel that could be the downfall of zaibathopia and cause it to perish like the disu‚Äôs.<br>
After an eternity scouring the skies trying to locate zaibathopia he encountered the bloody lake that dissolved the disus, with their skulls still bobbing in the currents of the water (aka H to the 2-O with some added sickle cell anaemia which exuberates the flavour). His mere presence shook the lands as he kamikazes in to the remains of the lake desecrating it from the plains of reality. He quietly stumbled towards zaibathopia in search of an inn for the night. The succulent yet voluptuous mortal being, that is his royal fuckery, graced the lands with his statuesque up till now monstrous plump of an arse. <br>
He enters the tavern and parades the lobby as the high arse-holiness he was and scouted the area for the intel. This was the meeting place however it was dead, not a soul in sight. The suddenly an eerie voice whispered through the cracks of the walls. The doors creaked as the spiritual leader approached where normal eyes couldn‚Äôt see anymore. But The Blender wasn‚Äôt normal, he was a graduate from the K2 ward and held a degree owl visionary. His job granted him the ability to build up an immunity to bullshit. Because of this he knew he was reaching the murky depths of the lobby‚Äôs end. He Jason stathomed the door and confronted a contortioned figure. Neither new the other nor did they need to as all the blender needed was intel. The entity slid a briefcase across the room and as the blender picked it up it was vanished in front of his very owly eyes.<br>
With the intel in hand the blender prepared to take off again when suddenly he felt a hot pain in his arse. He tries to turn but is restrained by a brutal force which he then saw was a powerful hand, a hand which used that brute force all on itself usually. Realising he was being taken advantage of whilst his chastity was at jeopardy he called on all his might and released the biggest shit zaibathopia had ever seen, even though zaibathobia is a town made of shit. The attacker now startled fled the scene however it was now clear who it was. The beast himself‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe Cu‚Äôd!‚Äù.
